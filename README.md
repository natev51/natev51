## Hi there, I am Nathan Davis

- Iâ€™m currently working on plasma coupled antennas and building a fusion device for my PhD in Applied Physics. I dabble in 3D printing, printed circuit board design, machining, and vacuum system design. 
- I'm currently learning about LabVIEW and Python. I use the Actor Framework in LabVIEW for control of the fusion device and Python for a number of data analysis requirements including libraries like matplotlib, polars, scikit-rf, scipy, scikit-learn, and numpy.
- Eventually, I'd *like to* collaborate on the open source Actor Framework project and contribute to the repo on LabVIEW SOLID Design Patterns. My personal project is to build an interface-driven actor model, https://github.com/natev51/jettl. This takes great inspiration from the National Instruments Actor Framework (https://github.com/ni/actor-framework).
