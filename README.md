## Hi there, I am Nathan Davis

- Iâ€™m currently working on plasma coupled antennas and building a fusion device for my PhD in Applied Physics. I dabble in 3D printing, printed circuit board design, machining, and vacuum system design. 
- I'm currently learning about LabVIEW and Python. I use the Actor Framework in LabVIEW for control of the fusion device and Python for a number of data analysis requirements including libraries like matplotlib, polars, scikit-rf, scipy, scikit-learn, and numpy.
- I'd *like to* collaborate on the open source Actor Framework project and build up a repo on LabVIEW SOLID Design Patterns. I've tried my luck *(it works)* by building a LabVIEW-based actor model strictly using composition of objects, instead of inheritance of objects.. it *very very closely* resembles the National Instruments Actor Framework which does not implement interfaces and is based on inheritance.<br>
