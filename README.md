## Hi there, I am Nathan Davis

- Iâ€™m currently working on plasma coupled antennas and building a fusion device for a PhD in Applied Physics.
I dabble in 3D printing, electronics, printed circuit board design, machining, and vacuum system design.
- On the software side, I'm currently learning about LabVIEW and Python.
I use the NI Actor Framework in LabVIEW for control of the fusion device and Python for a number of data analysis requirements including libraries like matplotlib, polars, scikit-rf, scipy, scikit-learn, and numpy.
- I have been developing an open source LabVIEW Actor Model based on Interface Composition.
It separates concerns by using many interfaces, leading to a truely decoupled design.
Tools such as tenplates, renaming, and message rescripting have been developed to speed the development process.
Youtube videos as a starter guide are under way.
